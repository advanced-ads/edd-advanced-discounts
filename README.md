# edd-advanced-discounts
Added more filters for discounts in Easy Digital Downloads

Included features:

* exclude a discount for lifetime products, needs Software Licensing add-on
* exclude specific price options (per ID), needs Software Licensing add-on

Notes:

Since EDD discounts are not checked when a specific product is added to the cart you should use the option to only apply discounts with product based checks to specific products.
Otherwise, a user could add the discount to your cart with a valid product, then add a product to which the conditions fit, but the discount is still used for it. He could even remove the valid product and still get the discount.
